# myProduct
Set of backend APIs which allows the user to manage products and their manufacturer. As this is a backend express project, so to test the APIs I use HTTP client (Postman) and do the CRUD operations on the Products and Manufacturer Tables. Tools & Libraries used are Node.js, Express, RestAPI & MySql as the database.
